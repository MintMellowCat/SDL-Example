# SDL-Example
This is a base file for using SDL with C++. To use copy it to a location and follow a tutorial of how to use CMake with SDL or if using Linux, download the SDL library using the default package manager on your system (I use arch so it is 'sudo pacman -S sdl2') and run the build and run file by running these commands: 'chmod +x build-and-run.sh' and then './build-and-run.sh'.
